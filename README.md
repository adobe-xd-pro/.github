# Adobe XD 
Adobe XD, also known as Adobe Experience Design, is a leading design software developed by Adobe. This graphics, wireframing and prototyping tool helps users create and design user interfaces (UI) as well as user experiences (UX) for websites and mobile apps. As part of the Creative Cloud suite, Adobe XD seamlessly integrates with other popular tools such as Photoshop, Illustrator or InDesign, making it easier than ever to bring a successful project to life.

## What is Adobe XD and what is it used for?
Adobe XD is the industry leading software for designing user interfaces (UI) and user experiences (UX). This vector-based software is widely used by professionals to create websites and wireframes as well as mobile and web apps. Like inVision Studio, a similar competitor,  Adobe offers a wide range of intuitive tools to connect screens and build interactive prototypes, all without the need to write a single line of code. These features, along with its seamless integration to the rest of the Adobe suite through Creative Cloud, makes XD the go-to choice over popular alternatives such as Sketch or Figma. 

## Main features of Adobe XD
Adobe XD is a popular and developer-friendly software that year after year has gained the popularity and approval from UI/UX designers all over the world. Some of its more outstanding features are these:
- Create vector graphics- Adobe XD allows you to create and edit vector shapes and graphics directly within the application.
- Interactive prototyping- With XD you can create interactive prototypes, as well as link artworks, define transitions and include user interactions without having to write any line of code.
- Design and auto-animate artboards- Create, design and easily bring artboards to live with just a single document.
- Repeat grid- Simplify the process of repeating lists and grids thanks to XD’s helpful automated feature.
- Responsive resize- Resize the elements and orientations of your artboard and project easily, so it adjusts to multiple screen sizes.
- Plugins- Adobe XD supports third-party plugins to enhance and improve your design workflow.
## An easy-to-use and responsive interface
Most designers and developers have used an Adobe product at some point in their lives. As part of the Adobe Creative Cloud, Adobe XD has a familiar interface. While the tool panel is located on the lefthand side of the main window, the layers, styles, and symbols are on the right. There is no steep learning curve and you can be sure that it is easier to work around symbol overrides and complex design systems.

## How to create a project with Adobe XD
To get started with your first project in XD, you'll need to work on a new artboard. This represents the specific screen you want to design for the prototype. Just like Photoshop CC and Axure RP, you can work with multiple artboards. While starting a new project, you can choose from preset sizes for common web and mobile resolutions. Additionally, you can easily create a customized artboard.

While using Adobe XD, you can conveniently move different elements between artboards with a drag-and-drop mechanism. You can even select multiple artboards to cut, delete, copy, or edit certain elements. The program lets you add grids to correctly position the elements in the artboard.

Adobe XD comes with two grid options - Layout Grids and Square Grids. With Layout Grids, you can define columns in the artboard. This feature is quite useful for understanding how every element responds to different breakpoints. In fact, this is a basic requirement in responsive designs.

On the other hand, Square Grids are useful for aligning text and objects. If you’re drawing a shape, the edges will automatically fit in the grid, allowing you to reduce errors. It even saves a good amount of your time.

Compared to Framer and other such apps, Adobe XD lets you work in two different modes. With the Design mode, you can create stunning visuals, wireframes, and low or high-quality mockups. On the other hand, the Prototype mode lets you add interactions, which simulate the required flow of the entire project.
